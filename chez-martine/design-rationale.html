            <h2>My Design Rationale</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>The audience</h3>
                <p>Based on my research on the three competitors listed above, I distinguish three types of
                    audiences.</p>

                <p>The first competitor &quot;Thobors&quot; is focused on more of a residential/family audience because they serve a variety of large cakes, sandwiches and other sweet treats at reasonable prices.<br>
                The second competitor &quot;Marvelous by Fred&quot; is aimed at shoppers of all ages, as well as retail workers in the local neighborhood who are looking for something quick to eat during there lunch break.</p><br>
                <p>Finally, the third competitor &quot;Nadege&quot; is directed at a clientele that is a mix of the two competitors. The target audience is residential/family and consumers with a higher disposable income.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Chez Martine’s&quot; target audience would resemble &quot;Nadege&quot;'s target market more than the other two competitors as &quot;Chez Martine&quot; focuses on offering high quality products/ingredients at a higher price range which will overall attract consumers with higher disposable income.</p>
                <p>In addition, as &quot;Chez Martine&quot; is located on Yonge and Bloor, the other target market would be working business professionals and general foot traffic.</p>
                <p>The three websites that I researched appear to be developed by Word Press.<br>
                The meta "keywords" is hidden for all three of them and the meta "description" is hidden for two of them.<br>
                Due to the hidden keywords, I can assume that some obvious keywords such as &quot;French croissant, French bakery, French pastry, French pastries, French food, best croissant in Toronto&quot; are used by the public to find these three competitors.</p>
                <p>For the competitor whose description is accessible, it seems to be well adapted because it summarizes both the history and the specialty of the retailer, in two sentences.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>The site metaphor</h3>
                <p>The message conveyed by the site is a feeling of being directly in a high-end Parisian bakery, without the &quot;coldness&quot; that can sometimes come with chic.</p>
                <p>The logo of Chez Martine has an Eiffel Tower instead of the "a", which immediately gives the indication that these are French products.</p>
                <p>The choice of the font family for the logo and titles supports the idea of being in front of Parisian products.</p>
                <p>The photo on the home page presents the bakery with an ambiance that makes the customer want to come back and visit so that they have a sense of being in a chic bakery in France.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>The design summarized</h3>
                <p>When I opted for this design, I wanted to give the website visitors the impression of going directly into the store.<br>
                For that reason, I decided to have a picture of the interior of the bakery on the home page, accompanied by a slogan to attract people. I wanted to give the impression to the customer to feel like they are literally in front of a Parisian bakery. For instance, the header and the margin on the sides represent the exterior of the building and the main section (the picture) represents the front of the bakery. The image of the bakery in the center gives customers a chance to see what inside looks like (from a desktop mode).</p>

                <p>I first opted for the charcoal colour for the header and the columns to reinforce the chic side of the bakery as you can find in Paris.<br>
                I then chose to integrate the brown colour of the wood that can be found on the interior photo. I chose to use lighter brown colours for the background of the other pages because I wanted to avoid the coldness of white because it is something I felt from other competitors, especially from &quot;marvelous by Fred&quot; website.</p>
            
                <p>It is very important for all kind of store to be present on social media and it seems that &quot;Nadege&quot; and &quot;Thobors&quot; are aware of it. I decided to add links to these platforms in the footer of &quot;Chez Martine&quot;'s website but I wanted to get rid of their original colour to give the impression that these links are perfectly blended into the website design. </p>

                <p>I found a section on all three websites about the history of the owners/bakers and how they got to where they are today.<br>
                I also wanted to incorporate this section on my websites for the customers because I want them to identify themselves with the product and it allows me and the other websites to humanize the screen they are looking at.<br>
                I added the history about the owner and his story about his mother and the important information about the quality of the products being used.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, two of the competitors have a photo gallery on their websites.<br>
                I did not want to include it in my design because I found it overwhelmed the main content of the website. I wanted the customer experience to be simpler.</p>

                <p>On the products page, I wanted to present the products sold very simply, with one product per line, and a separate category for each section. I decided to have all the products listed on the same page. The layout by &quot;Marvelous by Fred&quot;'s has products on several pages and &quot;Nadege&quot;'s layout shows products having a menu scrolling in a navigation icon. I found both these layouts to be rather confusing and less simple to navigate.</p>

                <p>I have chosen to re dimension all the pictures to a small size for the purpose of the page but I have decided to give the possibility to the consumer to click on the each picture to see it in its original size in an other window.</p>
                <p>Finally, two of the competitors have a section with contact info. I thought it woud be great to include one of this section in my design because it is important for the customer to be able ta reach the store if needed. I decided to add a map from google map because it helps the consumer to visualize where is located the bakery.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Obstacles and challenges</h3>
                <p>I would have liked to present the products more like &quot;Thobors&quot; layout. For example, the menu page has its own navigation with all its categories and once you click the link it changes the content but remains on the same menu page. Unfortunately, I do not have technical knowledge for that yet.</p>
                <p>I was also hopping to create a &quot;cart page&quot; for the customers to see the recap of what they ordered but, again, my actual skills don't allow me to do it.</p>
                <p>In addition, I wanted the text in white and the h2 titles in the same brown colour as my navigation but, even if I felt the colours compliment each other, WAVE specified that it was a contrast error. For that reason, I opted for black for the text and a deep dark brown for the h2 titles, following the recommendations of a contrast checker.</p>
                <p>Finally, I would have liked to align all the names of the products and all the prices, keeping the images of the products and the cart button the same way. I started to create a class for all the names products but I could not find a way to do so.</p>
